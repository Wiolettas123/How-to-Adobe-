Web Server Application 


Web server Application was one of the modules that Ive completed. In this module we proposed, designed and developed a robust web application that integrates data from a third-party data source into one application. I decided to create a tutorial application where by the use of API data from YouTube users are able to view any tutorial they want to see on one website.



Users can easily use the website/application by simple using the navigation bar that will take them to different sections of the page like 'Dreamweaver' or 'Photoshop' where they can open already loaded youtube tutorials or using the search box, enter any name of the tutorials they would like to see, this will then automatically take them to another page (result.php) where all the videos with similar names are dispalyed. 

The code that was used is Html, CSS & PHP. Ive also used Bootstrap taken from W3schools to help me with the design of the website/application.
